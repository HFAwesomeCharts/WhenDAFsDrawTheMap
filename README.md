### Abstract
Donor-advised funds, or DAFs, have rapidly become a powerful force in American charity. As intermediaries that reside between donors and their ultimate charity recipients, DAFs raise questions about whether they are bringing additional donors and revenue to operating charities, or instead crowding out other giving methods and delaying funding. DAF sponsors, the organizations that house and manage DAFs, are charities themselves, and this raises equally important questions about how DAF programs may influence sponsors’ charitable behavior. We study this latter aspect of DAFs by examining if and how a sponsor’s level of reliance on DAFs for its own funding is associated with the degree of focus it exhibits in its geographic mission. As would be expected, we find that some types of sponsors (notably, community foundations) exhibit more geographically focused grantmaking than others (notably, national sponsors). But we also find that after controlling for sponsor type, a greater reliance on DAFs is associated with a much broader geographic dispersion of grants, and this feature persists across a variety of geographic-focus metrics. We further extend our analysis to consider the connections between geographic focus and DAF-related policy advocacy, funder characteristics, and regional differences, as well as the cause-related concentration of grants. Overall, the results suggest that when sponsors are more reliant on DAFs to fund their grants, they also exhibit greater mission drift in their grantmaking.
